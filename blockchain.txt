In a public blockchain system, the concern when it comes to identity is the binding of electronic identity inside the blockchain, which consists of a pair of public and private keys, the private key generates the public key address with the real identity of the person or people behind those pairs. The protection of private keys is a crucial concern for users.

In the context of an e-voting system, we are talking about the identity of voters inside the blockchain, the challenge is that, in a voting system, the identities of people participating must be verified to make sure that only eligible voters can participate and cast their vote. Meanwhile, the vote must be done anonymously so that no one can tell who voted on whom, and the voter should be able to track their vote without being able to prove or share their choice to avoid coercion.

To mitigate this problem, we think of an off-chain voter management system that allows authorities to verify voters before allowing them to cast their votes. In the prevoting phase, the voters must first register by providing proof of identity to authorities; this verification must be done automatically, and for this reason, we chose state-of-the-art identity verification methods based on face biometrics and liveness detection. The proof of identity will be the national electronic identity card (NEIC) that contains credentials that authorities can verify and a personâ€™s face that they can match with the person requesting the registration. We chose the face as a biometric because most if not all people can get access to the digital camera found in their phones or computers. Other biometrics might require equipment that is not found in abundance.
